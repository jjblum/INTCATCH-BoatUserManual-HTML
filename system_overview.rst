INTCATCH Autonomous Boat System
-------------------------------

The realization of an easy to use system that can be used by non-expert users is a key aspect of the
INTCATCH project. In order to facilitate the boat deployment and the control of the boat, the current
solutions for autonomous navigation have been optimized by realizing software modules to detect the
status of the various systems connected with the boat and signal potential problems. This
allows to have an easy to deploy system and a fast checking procedure before putting the boat into the
water to detect if the system is running correctly.

Architecture of the System
--------------------------

The :ref:`RC controller<rc_equipment>` can be used when the user needs a direct control of the boat
(e.g., for manually steering the boat).
It works on a radio signal thus allowing for long range (up to 1 km) connection to the boat.

When operating in autonomous mode, a :ref:`tablet<phone_and_tablet>` with the Android operating system can be used to control the boat.
The user can define a waypoint path on the tablet that the boat follows, navigating autonomously.
The path generated by the Android tablet app is sent via wireless connection to the :ref:`smartphone<phone_and_tablet>` placed onboard.

An Android server runs on the smartphone, which is responsible for managing the localization
(using the GPS receiver on the phone) and the logging of the data coming from the :ref:`sensors<bluebox_and_sensors>` for water quality monitoring
(e.g., dissolved oxygen, electrical conductivity, and temperature).
The :ref:`smartphone<phone_and_tablet>` is connected to an Arduino Due board via a USB connection.
The :ref:`e-board<eboard_and_arduino>` is a shield board for the Arduino and represents the interface between the high-level commands
coming from the :ref:`smartphone<phone_and_tablet>` to the low-level commands going to the motors. The :ref:`e-board<eboard_and_arduino>` can be connected
to the :ref:`RC receiver<rc_equipment>`, to the :ref:`BlueBox<bluebox_and_sensors>`, and to other devices (e.g., a :ref:`sampler<platypus_sampler>`).
