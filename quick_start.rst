.. quick start! One simple html page with very brief sections
.. that summarize many of the other pages.

.. enough to get you to turn the boat on and get some data to appear
.. on the tablet. User will have to follow the various links to find
.. more detail on any one topic.



First thing, charge your devices and batteries. 
Charge :ref:`the phone and tablet<phone_and_tablet>` and :ref:`LiPo battery<charge_the_battery>`.

If the phone and tablet do not already have the INTCATCH apps installed,
:ref:`install the phone app<install_phone_app>` and the :ref:`tablet app<install_tablet_app>`.

Practice the :ref:`start-up sequence<boat_setup>` 
and :ref:`shut-down sequence<after_deploying>` with the boat on a table. 
If you have trouble, take a look at the :ref:`troubleshooting<troubleshooting>` section.

Double check that the propellers (or airfan) are thrusting in the
correct direction before putting the boat in the water.

Practice :ref:`controlling the boat<controlling_the_boat>` on calm
water, such as a pond. Steering the boat will take a bit of practice,
and flowing water is not appropriate for a first attempt.
Until you can pilot the boat through a smooth figure-eight shape,
you should avoid flowing water!
